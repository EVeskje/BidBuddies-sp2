## Description

[BidBuddies](https://bid-buddies.netlify.app/index.html) is an engaging online auction marketplace where users can participate in auctions by bidding on items or listing their own items for auction. Each new user starts with 1000 credits, which they can use to bid on items or accumulate by selling their own. While anyone can browse through the listings, only registered users have the privilege to place bids and view detailed listing information, making it a vibrant community for buying and selling.

### Features:

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive design powered by Bootstrap.
- **Auction System:** Users can bid on items, with credits being the primary currency.
- **Search Functionality:** Non-registered users can search through listings.
- **Credits Management:** Users gain credits by selling items and spend them by purchasing through bids.

### Built With:

- **Vanilla JavaScript:** Core logic and interactions.
- **Bootstrap:** Responsive and modern design.
- **Noroff Auction API V2:** Back-end data handling and integration.
